# SEB assistant task
This repo contains a mix of HTML, CSS, and JS files. The code is not great! There are a few issues that the author needs feedback on.

Here's what we would like you to do:

- Fork this repo to your GitHub (if you don't have an account, you'll need one for the course, so best to create one)
- Create a new branch and start reviewing :mag:
- Every time you find a mistake, correct it and add a comment in the code explaining why you made these changes
- When you're done, just send us a link to your repo if the visibility is set to public, or add [lovecirculardev](https://github.com/lovecirculardev) as a collaborator

<p class="callout info">Please note that you won't actually give students feedback through code comments! The students will be using Pull Requests which you will be able to add comments to.</p>

Remember that you will be teaching absolute beginners, so make sure your explanations are suitable for someone who doesn't know all the concepts and terminology!

We also like to teach the students to do their own research (Googling is a useful skill for software developers, right? :wink:), so we don't expect you to hold the students' hands too much; it's fine for you to give a basic explanation then send them resources.

Good luck :muscle:
